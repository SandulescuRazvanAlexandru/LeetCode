# Remove Vowels from a String

## Description
This repository hosts a solution for the problem of removing all vowels from a given string. The function implemented here takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string with all the vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') removed from it.

## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, the objective is to remove the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' from it and return the new string.

### Examples
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: `s = "leetcodeisacommunityforcoders"`
  - Output: `"ltcdscmmntyfrcdrs"`
  - Explanation: After removing the vowels from the input string, the resulting string is "ltcdscmmntyfrcdrs".

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: `s = "aeiou"`
  - Output: `""`
  - Explanation: Since all characters are vowels, the resulting string is empty.

### Constraints
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
